# Multi-processing Optimization

## Executive Summary

The CRO Analyzer currently supports 2-3 concurrent requests but is not optimized for production multi-user scenarios. This document outlines the current state, identifies bottlenecks, and provides a roadmap for scaling to handle 5-100+ concurrent users.

---

## Current State ‚úÖ Partial Support

### What Works

**FastAPI Async Architecture**
- Application uses `async def` handlers enabling concurrent request handling
- Built on ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)
- Non-blocking I/O operations supported

**Async Playwright Implementation**
- Uses `async_playwright()` API for browser automation
- Each request spawns independent browser instance (line 288 in [main.py](main.py#L288))
- Prevents resource conflicts between concurrent requests

**Proper Cleanup**
- Browser instances properly closed in `finally` blocks (line 475 in [main.py](main.py#L475))
- No obvious memory leaks in happy path

### Current Performance Estimate

| Concurrent Users | Status | Expected Behavior |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| 2-3 users | ‚úÖ Works | May experience slight slowdown |
| 5-10 users | ‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded | Significant delays, possible timeouts |
| 10+ users | ‚ùå Fails | Timeouts, resource exhaustion, crashes |

**Per-request resource consumption:**
- Memory: 200-500MB per browser instance
- CPU: High during screenshot capture and image processing
- Time: 10-20 seconds per analysis
- Network: Claude API calls (synchronous blocking)

---

## Key Issues üö®

### 1. Sequential Browser Launches
**Location:** Lines 288-290 in [main.py](main.py#L288-L290)

```python
browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
context = await browser.new_context(viewport={"width": 1920, "height": 1080})
page = await context.new_page()
```

**Problems:**
- Each request launches a new Chromium instance (~1-2 seconds startup overhead)
- Browser startup is pure overhead that doesn't contribute to analysis
- No browser instance pooling or reuse
- Cold start penalty on every request

**Impact:** Wastes 10-15% of total request time on browser initialization

### 2. No Concurrency Limits
**Location:** No rate limiting or request queue management implemented

**Problems:**
- FastAPI allows unlimited concurrent requests by default
- No maximum concurrent request enforcement
- No request queuing system
- Could accept more requests than system can handle

**Impact:** Under high load, server will accept all requests but fail to complete them, leading to cascading failures

### 3. Single Process Deployment
**Location:** Line 519 in [main.py](main.py#L519)

```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, timeout_keep_alive=60)
```

**Problems:**
- Runs single Uvicorn process by default
- Does not leverage multi-core CPUs
- Python GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits CPU-bound operations to single core
- No horizontal scaling within single deployment

**Impact:** On a 4-core CPU, only utilizing ~25% of available processing power

### 4. Synchronous Claude API Calls
**Location:** Lines 310-337 in [main.py](main.py#L310-L337)

```python
message = anthropic_client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=4000 if deep_info else 2000,
    messages=[...]
)
```

**Problems:**
- Using synchronous `anthropic.Anthropic()` client
- Blocks async event loop during API call
- Cannot efficiently handle concurrent Claude API requests
- Async client (`anthropic.AsyncAnthropic`) available but not used

**Impact:** 30-50% of request time spent blocking the event loop

### 5. Resource Cleanup Risks
**Location:** Throughout request lifecycle

**Problems:**
- No timeout enforcement on browser operations (page.goto has 60s timeout but no global limit)
- Long-running requests hold browser instances indefinitely
- No circuit breaker pattern for failing requests
- No graceful degradation under load

**Impact:** A few stuck requests can exhaust all available resources

### 6. Missing Production Features

**Not implemented:**
- Request rate limiting (per-IP or global)
- Response caching for repeated URLs
- Health check depth (only checks API availability, not system resources)
- Metrics/monitoring (request duration, queue depth, error rates)
- Request timeout middleware
- Graceful shutdown handling

---

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Quick Win - Multi-worker Deployment ‚ö°
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Code Changes:** Minimal | **Improvement:** 2-3x throughput

**What it does:**
- Run multiple Uvicorn worker processes
- Each worker handles requests independently
- Leverages multi-core CPUs

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Update Dockerfile CMD
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--workers", "4"]

# Or for production with Gunicorn
gunicorn main:app --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Pros:**
- Zero code changes required
- Immediate performance improvement
- Works with existing codebase

**Cons:**
- Still launches new browser per request
- Multiplies resource consumption (4 workers = 4x memory)
- No request queuing or rate limiting

**Good for:** 5-10 concurrent users

**Files to modify:**
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile#L54)
- [main.py](main.py#L519) (if running locally)

---

### Option 2: Browser Pooling + Rate Limiting üéØ
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Code Changes:** Moderate | **Improvement:** 3-5x throughput

**What it does:**
- Create pool of pre-launched browser instances
- Reuse browsers across requests
- Limit concurrent requests to prevent overload
- Add request timeout middleware

**Implementation overview:**
1. Browser pool manager with 3-5 warm browser instances
2. FastAPI dependency injection for browser acquisition
3. Semaphore-based rate limiting (max 5 concurrent)
4. Timeout middleware (60s max request time)

**Pros:**
- Eliminates browser launch overhead
- Predictable resource usage
- Prevents server overload
- Works well with existing architecture

**Cons:**
- Requires significant code refactoring
- Browser pool state management complexity
- Need to handle browser crashes/restarts

**Good for:** 10-20 concurrent users

**Files to create/modify:**
- New: `browser_pool.py` (browser pool manager)
- New: `middleware.py` (rate limiting and timeout)
- Modify: [main.py](main.py) (integrate pool and middleware)
- Modify: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (add `limits` or `slowapi`)

---

### Option 3: Full Async + Task Queue üöÄ
**Difficulty:** Advanced | **Code Changes:** Significant | **Improvement:** 10x+ throughput

**What it does:**
- Convert to fully async architecture
- Background task processing with Celery/Redis
- Async Anthropic client
- Browser pool with health monitoring
- Webhook callbacks for long-running analyses

**Implementation overview:**
1. Add Redis for task queue and caching
2. Celery worker processes for background analysis
3. Convert `/analyze` endpoint to return task ID immediately
4. Add `/status/{task_id}` endpoint for polling
5. Optional webhook support for push notifications
6. Async Anthropic client for non-blocking API calls

**Architecture:**
```
Client -> FastAPI (accepts request, returns task_id)
       -> Redis (queue task)
       -> Celery Worker (processes analysis in background)
       -> Redis (stores result)
       -> Client polls /status/{task_id}
       -> FastAPI returns result
```

**Pros:**
- Highly scalable (50+ concurrent users)
- Non-blocking API responses
- Can retry failed tasks
- Result caching built-in
- Graceful degradation under load

**Cons:**
- Significant architecture change
- Requires Redis infrastructure
- More complex deployment
- Breaking API change (no longer synchronous)

**Good for:** 50+ concurrent users, production environments

**Files to create/modify:**
- New: `celery_app.py` (Celery configuration)
- New: `tasks.py` (background task definitions)
- New: `redis_client.py` (Redis connection management)
- Modify: [main.py](main.py) (async endpoints, task submission)
- Modify: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (add `celery`, `redis`, `asyncio-anthropic`)
- New: `docker-compose.yml` (multi-service orchestration)
